      <h3>Welcome to my Portfolio Site!</h3>
    <section class="bio">
      <p class="bioP">I am a web developer and recent graduate of the Full-Stack Web Development Program @ Thinkful. I absolutely love programming because I thrive in an
         envionment where I can be both analytical [solving problems] and creative {creating useful applications}.
       </p>
        <hr class="hr3">
      <p class="bioP">Seeing this hard work come to life on the page is extremely rewarding to me.</p>
        <hr class="hr4">
      <p class="bioP">I have a background in K-12 Music Education and worked as an inner-city band
        director before "retiring" from teaching to pursue web development full time.
        I feel my unique life experiences have shaped a creative outlook, hard work ethic,
        and a get it done attitude that employers will be excited about. As an educator,
        I was always an advocate for life-long learning and I carry that into my day to
        day rituals and routines. I'm thrilled to now continue a life-long passion of mine
         full time!</p>
        <hr class="hr5">
      <p class="bioP">Beyond web development, you can find me performing on trombone in various groups
        throughout the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, exploring nature, grilling meat, enjoying a local craft brew, or watching
      reruns of Star Trek: TNG.</p>
